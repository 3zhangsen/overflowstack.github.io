# What is Overflow Stack?
Overflow Stack is the hub of the whole stack family.

Every kind of development has it's own domain, to simply put, has different kinds of technologies specific to that area. And it's frustrated to find out what technologies exactly a specific domain includes (The Stack). So we create dedicated technology stack for each domain. Our goal is to become full stack, or, rather, overflow stack!
